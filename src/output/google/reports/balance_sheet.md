## Balance Sheet Report

This report analyzes the financial health of the company based on its balance sheet data for the periods ending March 31, 2022, and March 31, 2023.  The analysis focuses on key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess liquidity, solvency, asset management, profitability, and capital structure.

**1. Liquidity Ratios (Short-term Financial Health)**

* **Current Ratio:** 
    * 2022: 1.33
    * 2023: 1.95
    The current ratio improved significantly from 2022 to 2023, indicating a stronger ability to meet short-term obligations.  A ratio above 1 is generally considered healthy, and the increase suggests improved liquidity.

* **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):**
    * 2022: 0.74
    * 2023: 1.29
    Similar to the current ratio, the quick ratio also shows improvement, suggesting a better ability to pay off current liabilities with readily available assets.  The increase reflects enhanced short-term liquidity.

* **Working Capital:**
    * 2022: 63.46
    * 2023: 185.34
    Working capital increased substantially, indicating a healthier operational liquidity position.  This signifies the company's improved ability to fund day-to-day operations.


**2. Solvency Ratios (Long-term Financial Stability)**

* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:**
    * 2022: 2.83
    * 2023: 2.03
    The debt-to-equity ratio decreased, suggesting a reduction in financial leverage. While still relatively high, the improvement indicates a move towards a more stable capital structure.  A lower ratio implies less reliance on debt financing.

* **Interest Coverage Ratio:**
    * 2022: Not applicable (Interest Expense = 0)
    * 2023: Not applicable (Interest Expense = 0)
    The interest coverage ratio is not applicable due to zero interest expense in both periods.  This suggests the company may not have significant debt requiring interest payments.


**3. Asset Management & Efficiency Ratios**

* **Return on Assets (ROA):**
    * 2022: 0
    * 2023: 0
    The ROA is zero for both years, indicating that the company did not generate any profit from its assets.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind this.

* **Fixed Asset Turnover:**
    * 2022: 0
    * 2023: 0
    A fixed asset turnover of zero suggests that the company's fixed assets were not effectively utilized to generate revenue.  This warrants further analysis to identify potential inefficiencies.


**4. Profitability Indicators**

* **Return on Equity (ROE):**
    * 2022: 0
    * 2023: 0
    Similar to ROA, the ROE is zero for both years, indicating no return on shareholder investments.  This requires further investigation to determine the underlying causes.

* **Gross Profit Margin:**
    * 2022: Not applicable (Revenue and COGS = 0)
    * 2023: Not applicable (Revenue and COGS = 0)
    The gross profit margin is not applicable due to zero revenue and cost of goods sold in both periods.  This suggests the company may not have generated any sales during these periods.


**5. Capital Structure & Leverage Analysis**

* **Equity Ratio:**
    * 2022: 0.26
    * 2023: 0.33
    The equity ratio increased, indicating a higher proportion of assets financed by equity. This suggests a stronger capital structure and reduced reliance on debt.

* **Debt Ratio:**
    * 2022: 0.74
    * 2023: 0.67
    The debt ratio decreased, confirming the reduction in the proportion of assets financed by debt. This aligns with the improved equity ratio and indicates a healthier capital structure.


**6. Cash & Reserves Analysis**

* **Cash and Cash Equivalents:**
    * 2022: 1.55
    * 2023: 3.9
    Cash and cash equivalents increased slightly, suggesting a modest improvement in liquidity reserves.

* **Retained Earnings:**
    * 2022: 25.59
    * 2023: 85.94
    Retained earnings increased significantly, indicating that the company has reinvested a substantial portion of its profits (although the net income is reported as 0, this may be due to accounting practices or other factors).


**Overall Assessment:**

While the liquidity ratios show improvement, the zero values for ROA, ROE, and the lack of revenue and COGS raise serious concerns about the company's profitability and operational efficiency.  Further investigation is crucial to understand the reasons behind these zero values and to develop strategies to improve the company's financial performance.  The increase in retained earnings despite zero net income warrants further scrutiny of the accounting practices.
