**6. Liquidity & Financial Stability Assessment**

* **Cash Flow Sufficiency:** The company demonstrates strong operating cash flow, but the negative net cash flow in earlier years and the significant increase in working capital raise concerns about short-term liquidity.  The reliance on long-term debt repayment also needs to be carefully monitored.

* **Debt-Equity Ratio Impact:**  The significant debt repayment positively impacts the debt-equity ratio, improving the company's financial leverage.

* **Overall Business Strategy Alignment:** The fund flows suggest a focus on operational efficiency and debt reduction. However, the increase in working capital needs further investigation to ensure alignment with the overall business strategy.


**7. Key Insights & Recommendations**

* **Positive Trend:** Strong operating cash flow indicates healthy core business operations.

* **Risk Factors:**  The significant increase in working capital and negative net cash flow in earlier years pose a liquidity risk.  Careful monitoring of receivables and inventory levels is crucial.

* **Recommendations:**  Conduct a thorough review of working capital management practices to improve efficiency and reduce the strain on liquidity.  Explore strategies to accelerate receivables collection and optimize inventory levels.  Continue the focus on debt reduction while maintaining sufficient liquidity to support business operations.
