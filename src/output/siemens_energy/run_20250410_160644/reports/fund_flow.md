**6. Liquidity & Financial Stability Assessment**

* **Cash Flow Sufficiency:** The company's ability to meet short-term obligations is questionable in the initial years due to negative net cash flow. However, the situation improves significantly by the end of the period. Long-term solvency is supported by the decrease in long-term debt.

* **Debt-Equity Ratio Impact:**  The decrease in long-term debt improves the company's financial leverage.

* **Overall Business Strategy Alignment:** Fund flows initially do not strongly support business growth, but the improvement in later years suggests a potential shift towards better financial management.


**7. Key Insights & Recommendations**

* **Positive Trend:**  Significant improvement in net cash flow from negative to zero by 2028.  Consistent positive operating cash flow.  Reduction in long-term debt.

* **Risk Factors:** Negative net cash flow in the initial years indicates potential liquidity issues.  Increases in receivables and inventory suggest potential issues with collections and inventory management.

* **Recommendations:**  Improve collection of receivables to reduce the strain on working capital.  Optimize inventory management to minimize unnecessary increases in inventory.  Explore additional sources of financing if needed to support growth and maintain sufficient liquidity.  Continue to reduce long-term debt.  Regularly monitor working capital and cash flow to ensure sufficient liquidity.
