## Balance Sheet Report

This report analyzes the financial health of the company based on its balance sheet data for the periods ending March 31, 2022, and March 31, 2023.  The analysis focuses on key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess liquidity, solvency, asset management, profitability, and capital structure.

**1. Liquidity Ratios (Short-term Financial Health)**

* **Current Ratio:** 
    * 2022: 1.33
    * 2023: 1.95
    The current ratio improved significantly from 2022 to 2023, indicating a stronger ability to meet short-term obligations.  A ratio above 1 is generally considered healthy, and the increase suggests improved liquidity.

* **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):**
    * 2022: 0.74
    * 2023: 1.29
    Similar to the current ratio, the quick ratio also shows improvement, demonstrating a greater capacity to pay off immediate liabilities without relying on inventory sales.

* **Working Capital:**
    * 2022: $63.46
    * 2023: $185.34
    The substantial increase in working capital from 2022 to 2023 further reinforces the enhancement in short-term liquidity.  A positive working capital signifies the company's ability to cover its current liabilities with its current assets.


**2. Solvency Ratios (Long-term Financial Stability)**

* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:**
    * 2022: 2.83
    * 2023: 2.03
    While still relatively high, the debt-to-equity ratio decreased from 2022 to 2023, suggesting a reduction in financial leverage.  A lower ratio indicates less reliance on debt financing.

* **Interest Coverage Ratio:**
    * 2022: Not applicable (Interest Expense = 0)
    * 2023: Not applicable (Interest Expense = 0)
    The interest coverage ratio cannot be calculated because interest expense is zero in both periods.  This suggests the company may not have significant debt requiring interest payments.


**3. Asset Management & Efficiency Ratios**

* **Return on Assets (ROA):**
    * 2022: 0
    * 2023: 0
    The ROA is zero for both years, indicating that the company did not generate any profit from its assets during these periods.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind this.

* **Fixed Asset Turnover:**
    * 2022: 0
    * 2023: 0
    A fixed asset turnover of zero suggests that the company's fixed assets were not effectively utilized to generate revenue.  This warrants further analysis to identify potential inefficiencies.


**4. Profitability Indicators**

* **Return on Equity (ROE):**
    * 2022: 0
    * 2023: 0
    Similar to the ROA, the ROE is zero for both years, indicating no return on shareholder investments.  This requires further investigation to determine the underlying causes.

* **Gross Profit Margin:**
    * 2022: Not applicable (Revenue and COGS = 0)
    * 2023: Not applicable (Revenue and COGS = 0)
    The gross profit margin cannot be calculated due to zero revenue and cost of goods sold in both periods.  This suggests the company may not have generated any sales during these periods.


**5. Capital Structure & Leverage Analysis**

* **Equity Ratio:**
    * 2022: 0.26
    * 2023: 0.33
    The equity ratio increased from 2022 to 2023, indicating a higher proportion of assets financed by equity.  This suggests a move towards less reliance on debt financing.

* **Debt Ratio:**
    * 2022: 0.74
    * 2023: 0.67
    The debt ratio decreased from 2022 to 2023, confirming the reduction in the proportion of assets financed by debt.


**6. Cash & Reserves Analysis**

* **Cash and Cash Equivalents:**
    * 2022: $1.55
    * 2023: $3.90
    Cash and cash equivalents increased slightly from 2022 to 2023, indicating a modest improvement in liquidity reserves.

* **Retained Earnings:**
    * 2022: $25.59
    * 2023: $85.94
    Retained earnings increased significantly from 2022 to 2023, suggesting that the company has been reinvesting profits for growth.


**Overall Assessment:**

The company shows improved short-term liquidity, as evidenced by the increased current and quick ratios and working capital.  There's also a reduction in financial leverage, indicated by the lower debt-to-equity ratio and higher equity ratio. However, the zero values for ROA, ROE, and gross profit margin raise serious concerns about the company's profitability and operational efficiency.  Further investigation is crucial to understand the reasons behind these zero values and to develop strategies to improve profitability and asset utilization.  The lack of revenue and cost of goods sold data also needs to be addressed.
