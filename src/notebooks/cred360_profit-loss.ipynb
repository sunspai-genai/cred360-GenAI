The increase in both gross and net profit margins indicates that the company is successfully managing its production and operating costs relative to its sales. However, it is essential to continue monitoring COGS and operating expenses to ensure they do not erode profitability as the company grows. The positive trends in operating income and net income suggest a healthy financial outlook, making the company an attractive prospect for investors.\n"

      "\n",
      "**Loan Approval Considerations**:\n",
      "- **Positive Aspects**:\n",
      "  - Strong revenue growth and increasing gross and net profit margins indicate a healthy business.\n",
      "  - The company is generating profits, which is a positive sign for loan repayment capability.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Negative Aspects**:\n",
      "  - High interest expenses relative to operating income may indicate potential cash flow issues.\n",
      "  - The operating profit margin is relatively low, which could raise concerns about operational efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the analysis, the company shows strong revenue growth and profitability, but the high interest expenses and relatively low operating profit margin are concerning. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation**:\n",
      "- **Loan Amount**: If the company is seeking a loan, a conservative approach would be to consider a loan amount that does not exceed 20-30% of the net profit, which would be approximately Rs. 17.18 lacs to Rs. 25.78 lacs (20-30% of Rs. 85.94 lacs).\n",
      "- **Rejection Reason**: If the company has a high debt-to-equity ratio or if the interest coverage ratio (Operating Income / Interest Expense) is low, it may lead to a rejection due to concerns about over-leverage and cash flow management.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, a detailed assessment of the company's cash flow statements, balance sheet, and industry benchmarks would be necessary for a final decision.\n"
