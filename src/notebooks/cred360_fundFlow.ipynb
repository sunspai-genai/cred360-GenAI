      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "- **Long Term**: There is a consistent surplus in long-term funds, indicating that the company is generating more funds than it is using in the long term.\n",

      "### Overall Assessment:\n",
      "The company has a strong long-term financial position but faces challenges in managing its short-term liquidity. This discrepancy suggests that while the company is generating sufficient long-term funds, it may need to address its short-term funding strategies to ensure it can meet its immediate obligations. This could involve improving cash flow management, reducing short-term liabilities, or increasing short-term financing options.\n"
